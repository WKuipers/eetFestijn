eetFestijn makes it easy to collect take-away orders for a large group. It is especially worthwhile when ordering from the same place on repeated occassions. Using eetFestijn, users can select items from a menu to compose their orders. A complete overview of all orders is automatically generated, as well as a 'simplified' summary that could be printed and taken along.
